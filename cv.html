<h1>CV</h1>
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3 class="cv">Digital Scholarship Librarian</h3>
<p class="subheader">Librarian I, Michigan State University Libraries</p>
<p class="sub-subheader">East Lansing, MI: 2016 - Present</p>
<p>I support faculty, staff, students, and colleagues within the library in developing and teaching with digital scholarship. I support the mission and day-to-day operations of the Digital Scholarship Lab (the lab). Leveraging 9 years of experience in web based library software development, I create and work with code and web resources in support of the lab and the library. Finally, I stay abreast of new technologies and strategically learn new skills and methodologies, dependent on the needs of the lab’s partners and patrons, with particular focus on Omeka S and digital collections. I am currently working with two different projects that are implementing Omeka S instances, and I’m participating as part of the repository team developer group to assist with developing the new repository platform.</p>
<p>Before working in the lab, I was part of the Digital Scholarship &amp; Curation Services unit. As a member of that unit, I re-framed the Digital Scholarship (Technology) Librarian role into one that incorporated both technical
expertise and instruction. I led a team of colleagues from multiple departments to create a style guide for the digital repository. DS&amp;CS also advised colleagues in the library and across campus regarding digitization and digital preservation best practices.</p>

<h3 class="cv">Digital Library Programmer</h3>
<p class="subheader">Librarian I, Michigan State University</p>
<p class="sub-subheader">East Lansing, MI: 2015 - July</p>
<p>As a Digital Library Programmer, My role was to plan, code, test, and implement technologies and systems to
promote and advance the library mission. I worked with the repository team, as well as with Catalog Services, to further develop and enhance in-house, open source, and vendor created software and interfaces.</p>
<p>The emphasis of my work was on areas related to discovery and collection stewardship. In particular, I developed a workflow for automating transcription of audio materials, and selected, tested, and implemented an Islandora module in order to display transcripts. I was also an advocate for transitioning the repository team to the Agile/Scrum methodology, and was a founding member of the group that completed the successful pilot.</p>

<h3 class="cv">Web Services &amp; Emerging Technologies Librarian</h3>
<p class="subheader">Albion College</p>
<p class="sub-subheader">Albion, MI: 2011 - 2015</p>
<p>My role was to create content for, design, implement, and maintain the library website, including one full site migration and one redesign. I was the technical lead on the Library’s Summon implementation. I was responsible for administering the library ILS including server hardware and software maintenance, for the system shared between the college and public library. I facilitated a system migration from III Millennium to III Sierra during that time. I worked with librarians, faculty, and other stakeholders to manage the overall library web presence, including LibGuides, ILLiad, Summon, 360Link, the web catalog and eventually the digital repository. I trained and managed a student worker to assist with redesign and code refactoring projects, and I designed and implemented a Git workflow to improve our ability to collaborate efficiently.</p>

<h3 class="cv">Adjunct Reference/Instruction Librarian</h3>
<p class="subheader">St. Clair County Community College</p>
<p class="sub-subheader">Port Huron, MI: 2010 - 2011</p>
<p>Taught course-integrated library instruction for a variety of classes, particularly English 101. Provided reference assistance and technology help to students, faculty, and staff at the reference desk, via email and chat, and by phone. Adjunct instructed one section of English 101 in Spring 2011.</p>

<h3 class="cv">Instruction &amp; Reference Short-Term Position</h3>
<p class="subheader">University of Michigan Libraries</p>
<p class="sub-subheader">Ann Arbor, MI: 2009 - 2010</p>
<p>I was hired upon graduation in December 2009, after concluding my internship, to continue reference and instruction. My role was primarily to assist with the library instruction request load; I worked with various undergraduate classes providing course-integrated instruction. I participated as a memeber of the Lesson Study curriculum development committee, including giving test instructional sessions. I provided reference assistance at the desk and over chat. I worked with Amanda Peters on the annual Cafe Shapiro student writing contest and event. Finally, I analyzed the Shapiro Undergraduate Library's web presence in relation to that of other campus library sites and made recommendations for improvement.</p>
