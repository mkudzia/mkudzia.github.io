<h1>Hi there, I'm Megan</h1>
<p>I work at Michigan State University, as a Digital Scholarship Librarian.</p>
<p>I mostly work with students, faculty, and other librarians on digital scholarship projects, classes, and technologies.</p>
<p>As a Digital Scholarship Librarian at MSU Libraries, my role is to support faculty, staff, students, and colleagues within the library as they develop and teach with digital scholarship. I work closely with other members of the Digital Scholarship Lab team to keep the Digital Scholarship Lab a welcoming and vibrant place to be.</p>
<p>I provide assistance with and/or consulting and instruction on digital projects, including:
<ul>
	<li>Building interactive web exhibits or digital editions</li>
	<li>Processing and manipulating data, primarily using Python</li>
	<li>Creating data visualizations</li>
	<li>Project sustainability, including documentation, digital preservation, project management, and version control (consulting and instruction)</li>
	<li>Advising on usability (UX) and accessibility (a11y) concerns</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I came to this job with a strong background in web development and design (especially WordPress and Drupal), web server administration, Git version control, and Python programming. I have worked with Islandora, a digital repository CMS (Drupal, Fedora, and some other stuff bolted on). I'm currently sharpening up my Python skills for working with metadata, especially JSON.</p>

<p>When I'm not at work, I'm probably hanging out with my husband, our toddler, and our two cats. I like food, cooking, and baking. I love TV and movies, I play video games badly and cello pretty well, I enjoy D&amp;D, and I love discovering new (to me) fandoms.</p>
