<p>As Digital Scholarship Technology Librarian, my role is to support faculty, staff, students, and colleagues within the library to develop and teach with digital scholarship. In particular, I work closely with other members of the Digital Scholarship and Curation Services Unit to define, develop, and provide services. I also write code and develop web resources and software in support of the unit and the library. I provide services in the form of assistance with digital projects, including: building interactive web exhibits; processing and manipulating data for library, faculty, and student projects; creating data visualizations; and contributing to the further automation of digital processes for audio materials. I am also an advocate for design and usability concerns to the unit, as well as a primary implementer of solutions in these areas.</p>

<p>I came to this job with a strong background in web development and design (especially Wordpress and Drupal), web server administration, Git version control, and Python programming. I have worked with Islandora, a digital repository CMS (it's sort of Drupal plus). My goals for the summer include getting good a Jekyll and passable at Unity (particularly at using C#).</p>

<p>When I'm not at work, I'm probably hanging out with my husband and our two cats. I have tried many types of exercise but I'm not sure I count as committed to any of them; I keep on keeping on. I like food, cooking and baking, craft beer, etc. I love TV and movies, I play video games badly (although I have opinions re: console/PC), and I love discovering new (to me) fandoms. I love coloring.</p>
