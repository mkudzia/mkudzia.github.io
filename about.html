<h1>Hi there, I'm Megan</h1>
<p>I work at Michigan State University, as a Digital Scholarship Librarian.</p>
<p>I mostly work with students, faculty, and other librarians on digital scholarship projects, classes, and technologies.</p>
<p>As a Digital Scholarship Librarian at MSU Libraries, my role is to support faculty, staff, students, and colleagues within the library as they develop and teach with digital scholarship. In particular, I work closely with other members of the Digital Scholarship Lab team to keep the Digital Scholarship Lab a welcoming and vibrant place to be.</p> 
<p>I provide assistance with and/or consulting and instruction on digital projects, including: 
<ul>
	<li>Building interactive web exhibits</li> 
	<li>Processing and manipulating data, primarily using Python</li>
	<li>Creating data visualizations</li> 
	<li>Creating content for immersive environments, especially for VR with Unity and creating 360 video (consulting and introductory instruction)</li>
	<li>Project sustainability, including documentation, digital preservation, and version control (consulting and instruction)</li>
	<li>Advising on usability (UX) and accessibility concerns</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I came to this job with a strong background in web development and design (especially WordPress and Drupal), web server administration, Git version control, and Python programming. I have worked with Islandora, a digital repository CMS (it's sort of Drupal+++). My goals for the summer include getting good at Jekyll and passable at Unity (particularly at using C#).</p>

<p>When I'm not at work, I'm probably hanging out with my husband and our two cats. I have tried many types of exercise but I'm not sure I count as committed to any of them; I keep on keeping on. I like food, cooking, and baking. I love TV and movies, I play video games badly and cello pretty well, I enjoy D&amp;D, and I love discovering new (to me) fandoms.</p>
